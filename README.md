# little-flockers
A NetLogo adaptation of Alice Eldridge's "You Pretty Little Flocker" - itself an adaptation of Craig Reynolds' "Boids" model. This version is a modification of Wilensky's flocking dynamics model, drawn from the NetLogo model library. Supporting documentation includes Eldridge's paper, which explains aspects of her art project/model, and my (Miles Schneider) paper regarding this work and the current adaptation.
